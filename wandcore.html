      <h3>What is a Wand Core?</h3>
      <p>A wand core is the magical substance that resides at the heart of every wizarding wand. The core is critical to the wand’s magical ability and determines the wand's compatibility with its wizard or witch. Several magical creatures and objects provide the cores for wands, each with its own unique properties.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Types of Wand Cores</h3>

      <h4>1. Phoenix Feather</h4>
      <p>One of the rarest and most powerful wand cores, the Phoenix Feather is known for producing wands with a great range of magic. Phoenix feathers are known for their unique properties, especially their ability to demonstrate a strong connection with their user, sometimes resulting in difficult compatibility.</p>

      <h4>2. Dragon Heartstring</h4>
      <p>Dragon Heartstring is a strong and resilient core, producing wands that are powerful and often have a strong and aggressive nature. Wands with this core tend to be more loyal to their owners and can be very effective in duels.</p>

      <h4>3. Unicorn Hair</h4>
      <p>Unicorn Hair is known for its purity, providing a wand that produces very consistent and stable magic. These wands are typically best suited for witches or wizards who are highly focused and possess a clear moral compass.</p>

      <h4>4. Veela Hair</h4>
      <p>Veela Hair is a rare and controversial wand core. These wands are incredibly powerful but can sometimes lead to unpredictable results. They are often used by those who are skilled with charms and transformations, though not much is known about the core due to its rarity.</p>

      <h4>5. Thestral Tail Hair</h4>
      <p>Thestral Tail Hair wands are very rare, known for their ability to produce powerful, dark magic. These wands are difficult to master and are often more temperamental, but when used correctly, they can show incredible potential in the hands of a skilled wizard.</p>
