  <h1>About the Wizarding World</h1>

  <h2>What is the Wizarding World?</h2>
  <p>
    The Wizarding World is a hidden magical society coexisting alongside the non-magical (Muggle) world. It is home to witches, wizards, magical creatures, enchanted objects, and legendary places like Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
  </p>

  <h2>Magic and Its Practice</h2>
  <p>
    Magic in this world is a powerful, mysterious force that can be harnessed through spells, potions, and magical artifacts. Witches and wizards develop their skills through formal education, primarily at Hogwarts, where they learn to cast spells, brew potions, and care for magical creatures.
  </p>

  <h2>Hogwarts and the Four Houses</h2>
  <p>
    Hogwarts is divided into four houses—Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff—each representing distinct traits like bravery, ambition, wisdom, and loyalty. Students are sorted into these houses based on their personalities and values, which shapes their experiences at school.
  </p>

  <h2>History and Lore</h2>
  <p>
    The Wizarding World has a rich history filled with legendary wizards, epic battles against dark forces, and magical discoveries. From the founders of Hogwarts to the tales of the Deathly Hallows, the lore inspires generations of witches and wizards to come.
  </p>

  <h2>Community and Culture</h2>
  <p>
    Beyond Hogwarts, the magical community has its own customs, government (the Ministry of Magic), sports (like Quidditch), and media. Though often secretive to protect themselves, witches and wizards deeply cherish friendship, bravery, and the pursuit of knowledge.
