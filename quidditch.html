  <h1>The Wizarding World of Quidditch</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Quidditch is the most popular wizarding sport played on broomsticks. It is a fast-paced game involving four balls and seven players per team, and it is played on an oval-shaped pitch with three goalposts on each side. The game is known for its excitement, physicality, and skill, as well as its major role in the magical community’s social life.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Rules of the Game</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Each team consists of 7 players: 3 Chasers, 2 Beaters, 1 Keeper, and 1 Seeker.</li>
      <li>The Quaffle is used to score goals worth 10 points each.</li>
      <li>The Bludgers are enchanted balls that try to disrupt the game. Beaters hit these away from their team.</li>
      <li>The Golden Snitch is a small winged ball worth 150 points, and it is the object of the Seeker’s search.</li>
      <li>The game ends when the Snitch is caught, and the team that catches it gets 150 points.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Player Positions</h3>
    <h4>Chasers</h4>
    <p>There are three Chasers on each team, and their main task is to score goals by getting the Quaffle through one of the opposing team’s three goalposts. Chasers must work together to pass the Quaffle and avoid Bludgers, which are designed to disrupt play.</p>

    <h4>Beaters</h4>
    <p>Beaters are responsible for protecting their teammates from Bludgers and using their bats to hit the Bludgers towards the opposing team. Their main aim is to prevent the other team from gaining possession of the Quaffle or scoring points.</p>

    <h4>Keeper</h4>
    <p>The Keeper is essentially the team’s goalkeeper. They guard the goalposts and block any Quaffles that are thrown by the opposing team’s Chasers.</p>

    <h4>Seeker</h4>
    <p>The Seeker’s job is to catch the Golden Snitch, which is worth 150 points and ends the game. This is the most exciting and crucial position, as the Snitch is very difficult to catch and often decides the outcome of the match.</p>
